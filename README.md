# Ecommerce-Capstone
The purpose of this project is to design and implement a cloud-based e-commerce platform for a medium-sized food distributor. The solution will implement a means for customers to place orders directly as well as a platform to customize logistics. The aim of this solution is to enhance the satisfaction of customers, increase revenue for the food distributor, optimize operations, and gain valuable market insights. To fulfill this project, the solution will be deployed using Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines managed in Visual Studio Code and Github. The project will be deployed to a major cloud service provider, namely Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. 
The objectives of the project are:
To develop a functional e-commerce platform supporting product catalog management, order processing, payment gateways, inventory management, and customer relationship management integration.
To integrate with the companyâ€™s existing ERP software, inventory, transportation management, and logistics systems for real-time data synchronization. 
To enable flexible logistics options, including delivery slots, pick-up points, and special delivery instructions. 
To ensure that the solution can scale to increased demand from order volume and customer traffic.
To deploy CI/CD pipelines to develop, test, and deploy the product. 
To conduct testing to ensure that the platform is demonstrable and fully operational for the selected cloud provider.

Project Scope Statement
Justification:
The medium-sized food distributor is looking to overcome issues that exist within the traditional distribution models of similar businesses. These issues include a reliance on intermediaries, limited customer reach, reduced order visibility, and the ability to tailor logistics to specific customer needs being hindered. These issues result in lost sales opportunities for the company, decreased customer satisfaction, and operational inefficiencies. The food distributor looks to rectify this through the design and implementation of a cloud-based direct-to-customer ordering and logistics customization platform. This platform will allow customers to make orders directly without need for an intermediary and customize their delivery preferences. This solution will increase customer satisfaction, increase revenue, optimize operations, and provide the company with valuable market insights. 
Deliverables:
E-commerce platform with a front-end and back-end supporting catalog management, order processing, payment gateways, and customizable logistics options.  Will also include CRM features such as order tracking and data analytics for analyzing customer behavior. 
A working cloud solution with either Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. This will include compute resources, a managed database, and cloud storage. 
CI/CD pipeline in GitHub using Visual Studio Code in order to build, test, and deploy the platform. 
APIs simulating the integration with existing systems(ERP, inventory, and transportation management).
Documentation using simulated data from unit, integration, and user acceptance tests that includes simulated data. 
A functional demonstration that includes an order placement, logistics customization , and deployment with the cloud provider selected.
Project Scope:
The purchase of this project is to design and deploy a cloud-based e-commerce platform for a medium-sized food distributor. The e-commerce platform will include a front-end and back-end supporting catalog management, order processing, payment gateways, and customizable logistics options. Furthermore, there will be simulated ERP, inventory, and transportation management systems that will be integrated with. These integrated systems will need real-time data synchronization. To develop the solution, CI/CD pipelines will be deployed using Visual Studio Code and GitHub and deployed to either AWS, Azure, or GitHub. This project requires building, testing, and a demonstration of the operational cloud e-commerce platform, but will not require creating the integrated ERP and TMS systems or managing physical logistics.
Constraints:
This project will need to be completed over the course of the semester, with the semester ending May 6th, 2025.
Sole team member has no prior experience with cloud migrations besides theoretical knowledge.
Team disbanded 3 weeks into the course so the sole team member has to complete the project alone. 
Shifting work schedule and recent loan problems means very little time to work on project alongside other class assignments. 
Limited to free-tier services from one of the 3 major cloud providers. 
Should use Visual Studio Code and GitHub for CI/CD pipeline.
Should only be barebones architecture due to the nature of assignment without adding extraneous features.
Assumptions:
Free tier of cloud offerings will be suitable for the needs of the project.
Project scope will remain unchanged. 
The project will be achievable within the specified timeframe.
All resources will be available through the chosen cloud provider.
